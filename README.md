# EEG-Classification
This is a master project for Control, Microsystems and Microelectronics Program at Uni Bremen. The project aims to classify EEG data in an embedded system by using artificial neural network, more specifically Multilayer Perceptron Model.

# Electroencephalography Classification Second Part (Desktop Application)
This is a master project from Sushant and Vahap, master students at Uni Bremen. This project is tutored by Yarib Nevarez.
The project aims to develop and implement EEG signal classifier for detection of epileptic seizures.
The project software consists of two parts. This project is the second part (Eeg-Classification). The first part is to build a neural network by using python language to classify EEG signals.
The second part implements the neural network which is built in the first part, to perform classification. It is written in C language to be installed in FPGA board. The first part of the project is Eeg-Classification-Network-Builder and can be found here.

# What to do
1. Go to first part .
2. Run NeuralNetworkClass.py to create a neural network and export network parameters together with test data.
3. Copy and paste exported csv files in this part to perform classification on test data.
4. Run C code to perform classification on desktop application.
